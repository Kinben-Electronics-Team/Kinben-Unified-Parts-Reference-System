   ```bash
   curl -I https://the-clever-studio-f3b16.web.app/
   ```
   Should return `200 OK`, not `404` or connection errors

   - Ensure FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT secret exists
   - Confirm recent commits triggered deployment

3. **Test Basic URLs:**
   - https://the-clever-studio-f3b16.web.app/ (landing)

3. **Comprehensive Testing:** 60 minutes (all features, file uploads, edge cases)
4. **Bug Documentation:** 15 minutes (create issues for failures)

**Total Estimated Time:** 2 hours
