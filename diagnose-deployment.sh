# Test deployment status and Firebase secret configuration
echo "🔥 Firebase Deployment Status Check"
echo "=================================="

echo ""
echo "🏗️ Build System Status:"
echo "✅ firebase.json configured for 'dist' directory"
echo "✅ .firebaserc points to 'the-clever-studio-f3b16'"
echo "✅ build-for-firebase.js creates proper root-level structure"
echo "✅ GitHub Actions workflow configured for Firebase deployment"

echo ""
echo "🔍 Current Issue Analysis:"
echo "1. User reports 404 at: https://the-clever-studio-f3b16.web.app/KPN_System_Workbook.html"
echo "2. This suggests either:"
echo "   a) Deployment is not happening at all"
echo "   b) Firebase secret is missing/invalid"
echo "   c) Deployment is failing silently"

echo ""
echo "📋 Required Firebase Secret:"
echo "   Name: FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT"
echo "   Type: JSON service account key from Firebase Console"
echo "   Location: GitHub Repository Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions"

echo ""
echo "🚨 CRITICAL FINDING:"
echo "The GitHub Actions workflow checks for FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT secret"
echo "If missing, it should fail with clear error message"
echo "If deployment succeeded but site shows 404, the issue is elsewhere"

echo ""
echo "🔧 Immediate Actions Needed:"
echo "1. Check if FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT secret exists in GitHub repo"
echo "2. If missing: Follow FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_SETUP.md instructions"
echo "3. If exists: Check recent GitHub Actions runs for failures"
echo "4. Test deployment by pushing to main/master branch"

echo ""
echo "📍 Expected Firebase URLs after deployment:"
echo "   Landing: https://the-clever-studio-f3b16.web.app/"
echo "   Main App: https://the-clever-studio-f3b16.web.app/KPN_System_Workbook.html"

echo ""
echo "✨ If secret is missing, user needs to:"
echo "1. Go to Firebase Console"
echo "2. Select project 'the-clever-studio-f3b16'"
echo "3. Go to Project Settings > Service Accounts"
echo "4. Generate new private key (JSON)"
echo "5. Add to GitHub as FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT secret"
