# ðŸŽ¯ Manas Vision for Kinben Unified Parts Reference System

## Original Vision Statement

> "I want to use this system for my lab. Right now though the Assembly Tab is not functioning in the best possible way. I am writing my vision for the same and I want your help in planning the future as I have zero experience with HTML and software coding. 
> 
> 1) I want the assembly tab to help me add assemblies with detail like for example Top PCB for CMFL - This assembly has 1 Circuit board, Each cricuit board has it's own BOM. In order to complete the sensor assembly, we need a 3D printed enclosure, Some Screws, some standoffs and obviously the PCB etc etc. I should be able to come to assembly tab, select an assembly, put a quantity that I need and the page should be able to export a consolidated BOM for me with quantities etc automatically calculated.
> 
> 2) An assembly can be  - a) A Circuit Board Assembly which has 1 PCB and electronic components, mechanical parts, etc
> b) An assembly of Cable ie a few connectors, a few crimps, a piece of cable etc etc
> 
> 3) A typical workflow would involve generating BOM files from Kicad, Adding a PCB component in Component Tab followed by navigating to Assembly Tab and adding that PCB component to an assembly followed by an upload of BOM for that PCB, the system should cross reference the KPNs and add the parts to that assembly in child view, User should be allowed to then also enter any manual components to both child and mother view of assembly. once saved, the assembly will appear in the data view with it's component statistics. user should be able to delete, edit assemblies and also be able to edit,add and remove components from Assembly. Then the user would navigate to system tab and create a system with multiple assemblies. In system view too an user should be able to edit/add/remove assemblies from a system. User should not be able to edit/change components of an assembly IN SYSTEM TAB.
> 
> 4) User should be able to select one or multiple systems, enter quantity of the individual systems like a cart and should be able to checkout which generates a structured but single file Bill of material of all that is needed to make a system. A SYSTEM CAN BE SYSTEM OF SYSTEMS BUT AN ASSEMBLY CANT BE ASSEMBLY OF ASSEMBLIES.
> 
> Can you make me a plan of action for this app and how I can assign small chunks of tasks to AI agents without them using a lot of tokens to carry a tonne of context. I want you to come up with 
> a good plan for me and suggestions on how to accomplish this beautifully and efficiently and as fast as possible."
