# Claude Project Context & Progress

## Project Overview
**Project Name**: Kinben Unified Parts Reference System  
**Repository**: https://github.com/Kinben-Electronics-Team/Kinben-Unified-Parts-Reference-System  
**Live Production Site**: https://the-clever-studio-f3b16.web.app/KPS  
**Main Objective**: Production-ready KPN management system with GitHub as single source of truth

## 🚨 CURRENT CRITICAL STATUS

### 🎯 Single Source of Truth: ENFORCED
- **Source**: GitHub Repository (this repo)
- **Auto-Deploy**: Every push to master → Firebase
- **Live Site**: https://the-clever-studio-f3b16.web.app/KPS
- **No Local Development**: Eliminated all confusion

### 🚨 CRITICAL BLOCKER: Issue #22
**Problem**: Fixed PRs merged in GitHub but NOT deployed to live site
**Assigned**: manasdeore (for Copilot to pick up)
**Solution Needed**: GitHub Actions workflow to auto-deploy to Firebase

**PRs Already Merged (but not live)**:
- PR #13: File upload fixes ✅ (in GitHub)
- PR #16: Launch button fixes ✅ (in GitHub)  
- PR #15: Test improvements ✅ (in GitHub)

**Result**: User confirmed bugs still exist on https://the-clever-studio-f3b16.web.app/KPS

## ✅ Latest Session Accomplishments (2025-01-22)

### 🧹 Repository Cleanup COMPLETED
- ✅ **Removed telemetry spam** - `token-monitor.js` causing Claude terminal issues
- ✅ **Removed local deployment confusion** - No more `serve.py`, `dev-server.bat`
- ✅ **Removed documentation clutter** - 10+ redundant .md files deleted
- ✅ **Clean folder structure** - Only essential files remain

### 🎯 Issues Created for Copilot
- **Issue #22**: 🚨 CRITICAL - Deploy fixed code to live site (ASSIGNED)
- **Issue #23**: 🧪 Test live site functionality comprehensively
- **Issue Templates**: Created for future Copilot tasks

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Status

### ✅ Working Systems
- **GitHub Repository**: Clean, organized, single source of truth
- **Firebase Configuration**: Ready for deployment
- **Application Code**: All fixes merged in GitHub
- **Issue Tracking**: Clear assignments for Copilot

### ❌ Broken/Missing
- **Automatic Deployment**: GitHub → Firebase not connected
- **Live Site**: Shows old version despite GitHub updates
- **User-facing bugs**: Launch button, file upload not working on live site

## 🚀 Next Steps (For Copilot/Future Sessions)

### 🔥 IMMEDIATE (Issue #22)
1. **Update `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`**:
   - Add Firebase deployment step
   - Configure proper dist structure with KPS subdirectory
   - Use Firebase service account authentication

2. **Test Deployment**:
   - Verify GitHub push triggers Firebase deploy
   - Confirm https://the-clever-studio-f3b16.web.app/KPS shows latest fixes
   - All functionality works on live site

### 🧪 VALIDATION (Issue #23)  
1. **Test all claimed fixes on live site**:
   - Launch application button navigation
   - File upload/download functionality
   - No JavaScript console errors
   - Mobile responsiveness

## 🎯 Success Criteria

### ✅ When Complete
- Every GitHub push automatically deploys to Firebase
- https://the-clever-studio-f3b16.web.app/KPS shows latest code
- All functionality works on live production site
- No manual deployment steps required
- Clean development experience without terminal spam

## 📝 Development Notes

### 🤖 Claude Terminal Fixed
- Removed `token-monitor.js` that was causing telemetry output
- Cleared `CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_TELEMETRY` environment variable
- Clean startup experience restored

### 🎯 GitHub Workflow
- Issues created with detailed instructions for Copilot
- Proper assignee structure for automatic pickup
- Issue templates created for future tasks

## 💾 Session End Status
**Date**: 2025-01-22  
**Status**: 🚨 **CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED & ASSIGNED**  
**Next Action**: Copilot implementation of Issue #22 (Firebase deployment automation)  
**Repository**: Clean and ready for production automation  

---

## 🔄 IMPORTANT: Resumption Protocol
**When resuming development:**
1. **Check Issue #22 status** - Has Copilot implemented Firebase deployment?
2. **Test live site** - Are the bugs fixed at https://the-clever-studio-f3b16.web.app/KPS?
3. **Verify automation** - Does GitHub push trigger Firebase deploy?
4. **If still broken** - Debug deployment pipeline and test GitHub Actions

**The main blocker is deployment automation - everything else is ready to go!** 🚀
